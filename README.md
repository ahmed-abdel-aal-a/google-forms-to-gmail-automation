# Google Forms to Gmail Automation (Make.com)

A simple but powerful Make.com automation scenario that instantly notifies you via Gmail whenever a new response is submitted to your Google Form.

This project is a foundational example of lead notification and data entry automation, perfect for small businesses, freelancers, and personal projects.

## üöÄ Features

* **Instant Notification:** Automatically triggers when a new row is added to a specific Google Sheet (which is connected to a Google Form).
* **Dynamic Content:** Pulls data directly from the form submission (like Name, Email, and Message) and inserts it into the body of the notification email.
* **Easy to Deploy:** Ready to use! Just import the `blueprint.json` into your Make.com account, connect your apps, and activate.
